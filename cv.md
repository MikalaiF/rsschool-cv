## About me:  

&ensp;&ensp; Hi! I'm a happy RS student!
Passed stage-0 with flying colors! Got the cherished certificate, which means a lot to me, it's the document which gives me the incentive to work, it's living proof that you can learn anything. Yes, it's just a preparatory course, but it was very exciting and a little bit complicated, and I passed it! So further study will go the same way, with difficulties with which I will be able to cope!
I'm almost 29 years old and I want to get into IT! I sincerely believe in RS school, that it helps me and I will help it later!
